Most of the reading assignments below refer to the textbook:

\[Axler\] = Axler, Sheldon J. _Linear Algebra Done Right_. Springer, 2004. ISBN: 9780387982588. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=ovIYVIlithQC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]

A few topics not fully covered in the textbook are discussed in supplementary notes available in the [Study Materials]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/study-materials) section. These include:

\[F\] = Notes on Finite Fields

\[OSI\] = Notes on One-sided Inverses

\[GE\] = Notes on Gaussian Elimination

\[OB\] = Notes on Orthogonal Bases

\[ST\] = Proof of the Spectral Theorem

\[EIG\] = Notes on Generalized Eigenvalues
